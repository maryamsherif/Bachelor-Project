## Thesis Topic:  "*AR For Embroidery Design*". 🧵 
Using Computer Vision and Machine Learning, The project idea is to implement a software for embroidery designers that can make the design process easier without using complex softwares. <br>
### The steps for implementing this software are: 🎯 
1. Creating a machine learning model to recognize different actions for hand gestures, which are "Move Up", "Move Down", "Move Left", "Move Right", "Zoom In", "Zoom Out", "Rotate Right" & "Rotate Left".
2. After comparing the performance of 5 models that I've trained and tested, The CNN model had the best performance among them with 90% accuracy. 🤖
3. Creating a program that can control an image (emroidery design image) with the hand gestures mentioned above without the need to be involved in using a complex software. 🪄
4. Lastly, I implemented a simple desktop application which have the option to upload your design and then start the image control process.

### The Setup for the best experience: 📽️ <br>
1. An external Camera to face the user directly to be able to detect the hand-gestures using the ***Right Hand***  ✋ <br>
2. A projector that can be placed anywhere the user wants to be able to present the design clearly.

### How to run this code? 👨‍💻
- Simply run the `app.py` file and upload your design and Get Started! 🤩
